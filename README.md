# Data-Oriented Game Engine

namespace: doge

A game engine designed for writing data-oriented code.

Data-oriented code allows for easier debugging and tracking of variables.

It also allows for more modular design, and hence doge also support adding extensions easily.

This library uses [SFML](https://www.sfml-dev.org/) for cross-platform IO functions.



## Built-in Extensions

physics: provide rigid body physics simulation (with [Box2D](https://box2d.org/))

nine_slice: provide interface for 9-slice sprites using CompoundSprite

gui: provide a graphical user interface system that is more object oriented
