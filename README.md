# Data-Oriented Game Engine

namespace: doge

A game engine designed for writing data-oriented code.

Data-oriented code allows for easier debugging and tracking of variables.

It also allows for more modular design, and hence doge also support adding extensions easily.

This library uses [SFML](https://www.sfml-dev.org/) for cross-platform IO functions.



## Built-in Extensions

physics: provide rigid body physics simulation (with [Box2D](https://box2d.org/))
